    <p>Also try out the /user endpoint - navigate to localhost:8080/user to see a list of all users. <br />
    Then navigate to localhost:8080/user/ttrojan@usc.edu to search for the user with the email address "ttrojan@usc.edu" <br />
    Finally, try searching for a user that doesn't exist by navigating to localhost:8080/user/fakeEmail.</p>
